# 3D_houses

This repository provides a Jupyter notebook with the goal to let an end user generate a 3D plot of the house or building on a specified address within Flanders, Belgium. The main dataset being used to do this is publicly available, and originates from a governmental project called [DHMV II](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/dhm-digitaal-hoogtemodel-vlaanderen-ii) to update the [Digital Elevation Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model) of Flanders between 2013 and 2015.

This readme file isn't finished yet, but the notebook contains more documentation.
